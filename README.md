# Lost Ark Launcher
This is a super basic launcher that allows you to choose your server before launching  
the game by simply editing the UserOption.xml file for Lost Ark.

## Download ##
This is the launcher executable that you should download :
- [Lost Ark Launcher](https://github.com/Iceniq/LostArkLauncher/releases/download/1.0/LostArkLauncher.exe)

I've also included the PowerShell ISE file for those who would like to customize the launcher :
- [PowerShell ISE file](https://github.com/Iceniq/LostArkLauncher/releases/download/1.0/LaunchLA_GUI.ps1)
## How to Use
- Move the downloaded file to the main Lost Ark folder.

>Located here by default:
>
>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lost Ark

- Launch **Lost Ark Launcher.exe**.

## Notes
- This is completely safe and will not get you benned as the script only runs Windows tasks,  
then launches the game through Steam, as you would normally

- The launcher works without having Steam already running; it will launch it for you.

- This was made using **PowerShell ISE** and **PS2EXE**.
